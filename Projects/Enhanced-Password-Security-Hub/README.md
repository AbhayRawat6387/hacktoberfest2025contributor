## üé® Key Features Explained

### Advanced Analysis Algorithm
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures password randomness using character set size
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies sequential characters (abc, 123), keyboard patterns (qwe, asd), and repeating characters
- **Dictionary Checking**: Detects common passwords and dictionary words
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Combines multiple factors for accurate strength assessment

### Cryptographically Secure Generation
- Uses `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` for true randomness
- Supports character exclusion for better usability
- Customizable length and character sets
- No predictable patterns or biases

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded strength indicators
- **Privacy-Focused**: No data sent to servers, all processing happens locally

### Educational Value
- **Real-time Learning**: Understand password security as you type
- **Best Practices**: Integrated tips and recommendations
- **Crack Time Visualization**: Understand attack scenarios
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to identify weak password patterns

## üîß Customization

You can easily customize the analyzer by modifying these variables in `script.js`:

```javascript
// Add custom common passwords
this.commonPasswords = [
    'password', '123456', 'yourCustomPasswords'
];

// Adjust scoring weights
score += Math.min(length * 4, 50); // Length weight
score += hasSpecial ? 10 : 0;      // Special character bonus
```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ classes, arrow functions, template literals
- **Web APIs**: Crypto API, Clipboard API, DOM manipulation
- **Algorithm Design**: Password strength calculation, pattern matching
- **UI/UX Design**: Responsive layouts, animations, user feedback
- **Security Concepts**: Entropy, attack vectors, best practices
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient DOM updates, event handling

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All password analysis happens in your browser
- **No Data Transmission**: Passwords never leave your device
- **Secure Generation**: Uses cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Memory Safety**: No password storage or logging
